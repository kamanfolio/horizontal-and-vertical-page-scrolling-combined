# Horizontal and Vertical Page Scrolling Combined
This page demonstrates normal behavior of scrolling by default (up and down) and triggers to a horizontal page scrolling (left and right) once clicked on a button.

Instructions:
Scroll down the page and click on the CTA "See Characters".

Notes:
• In order to acheive the effects successfully and to prevent a bad user scrolling experience, sliding the entire Characters section to the left is necessary.
• The horizontal scrolling functionality works when user scrolls up and down or left and right, thanks to the wheel event.
• The horizontal scrolling functionality is disabled on mobile versions for better user experience and falls back to default scrolling behavior (up and down).

* The original idea was inspired by Apple.com
